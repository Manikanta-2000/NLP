His career started at Bullfrog Studios which in 1987 produced Populous one of the first God-games.  Mr Molyneux said that his involvement with the games industry started almost by accident as back in the early days game making was more a hobby than a career.  \"I thought everyone would treat Populous as weird,\" he said, \"but it became a huge international success.'"
